# KnittinAssistant

## What is Knitting Assistant?
This is a very very simple Android app that I created to help my mom with some of the usual calculations she does when knitting and sewing and crocheting her products.
The actual logic for the app is purely simple math so I finished this in a really small amount of time :p

## What did I learn?
This the first time I create anything in Kotlin, actually. It wasn't very different (which is good) and I'm excited that I'll be using moving forward! 
This project also expanded my knowledge and understanding of layouts. This is the first time I utilize Constraint Layouts, since I preferred Linear Layouts previously,
but now I see the "power" of Constraint Layouts and it felt really good finally getting rid of that "obstacle".

## What's Next for KnittingAssistant
As with a lot of projects here, I will most likely never look at them again as I move on to more ambitious projects with my newfound knowledge. 
However, I might come back to this app specifically if my mom needs some more functionality down the line! I hope that happens months from now so I can look back at what
newbie me was coding, and I could fix it
